# GitHub Projects Scraper

A project to be used in [zakariya.tech](https://zakariya.tech), will allow you to scrape the README.md files from every repo within a specified users' GitHub!

## TO-DO:
[] Implement a successful web scraper that runs within a configurable interval to check for any updates within a users' GitHub.

[] Create API to allow for easy interaction

[] Create a FileBlob Storage environment to allow for storing README.md files with a specific format, to allow for an automated list of projects to form on [zakariya.tech](https://zakariya.tech).
